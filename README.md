# ObjectOrientedCourse-Project
My ObjectOriented Project for IST Bachelor in Computer Engineering

This project consists in a Simple File Manager Unix Like.


The Project Specification is here:

In order to build and Run the Project, all poof-core, poof-textui (implemented by me) and po-uilib, poof-support (packages provided by the professor) must be compiled separately and all put together within the CLASSPATH Enviornment Variable.

Credit of po-uilib and poof-support go to David Matos, his page can be consulted here as well as his courses wiki.
