# ObjectOrientedCourse-Project
My ObjectOriented Project for IST Bachelor in Computer Engineering

This project consists in a Simple File Manager Unix Like.


The Project Specification is here: 
https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/566729524649092/poof-201411201010.pdf


In order to build and Run the Project, all poof-core, poof-textui (implemented by me) and po-uilib, poof-support (packages provided by the professor) must be compiled separately and all put together within the CLASSPATH Enviornment Variable.

Credit of po-uilib and poof-support go to **David Martins de Matos**, his page can be consulted here as well as his courses wiki.
